# TV Show project

## Instructions to run the project
* Clone the project
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev` to start

## Description of the project
* Made with React, TypeScript and Vite
* The `TanStack Query/React Query` library is used to fetch results from the API. This library was choosen for its ease of use and built in support for fetching, caching and feedback on server state.
* Navigation is built with `React Router`

## What would I add more
* To achieve the desired design where the header section with search field is present on both screens, the routing can be setup with nested routes and an Outlet. If I would have more time, I would go for this solution.
* More extensive error handling/boundaries to handle failed fetches and displayed in a nice way in UI.
* Styling finetuning on font styles and overall layout.
